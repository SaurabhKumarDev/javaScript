When we use the form in html that means form will be 'submit' for storing the data
that's why we have to use the submit type event in the js


form will submited in the form of get and post
form jab bhi submit hota hai toa voa do type se submit hota hai ya toa post ya phir get

In second project we cannott send the data to any database that's why we have to stop the sending data (url, details)
Here we only need to calculate general not more than that
preventDefault
preventDefault() won't let you check this! = Only for temp not more than that

when we use number type input box
that means js is not accept the string operation too also in window screen = ''

setInterval(function () {}


Best color combination

blue with white
black with white
red with #414141


JavaScript mai jitne bhi events hotey hai voa sab sequentially run hotey hai pr kuch exception bhi hoti hai
JavaScript ak Synchronous language hai par hum kabhi kabhi inn Synchronous programming ko ignore karke ASynchronous pe bhi jate hai kuch time ke liye like delay

Synchronous and ASynchronous
Synchronous = one by one execute
//
ASynchronous = not one by one 
 code = 
 function delay_Greeting() {
 setTimeout(function() {
   console.log("Hello, Ninja!");
 }, 5000); // Wait for 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds)
}

console.log("Start");
delay_Greeting();
console.log("End");
//


addEventListner = it is a powerFul listner Because of working it can be able to listne the button,click, submit,mouse, hover, keyboard


Events
1.) onclick() = when you click me, i will occur and start performing my jobs
APPROCH 1
2.) WithIn HTML -> onclick() = "alert('hii')";                  // This is not best approch //          // jquery mai ye alag baat hoti hai kiyoki vha pe ye scalable code hota hai
APPROCH 2
3.) within script -> select query.onclick = alert('hello');
4.) Id ke andar onclick event pe dikat ho skti hai kiyoki ye jada feature provide nahi karta 
    Because of this reason we suggest you to use the addEventListner kiyoki ye keval onclick nahi propogation ki ability bhi dete hai
5.)





There are three  parameter within the addEventListner 
1.) string event type - click, submit
2.) function - what it has to working
3.) Third parameter is boolean false, true, BY DEFAULT false is 3rd parameter








Whenever onclick event is called in script always use the function as a assignment type otherwise all thing will execute primary within the onclick event
