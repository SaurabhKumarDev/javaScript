                                BASIC INFORMATION OF JavaScript

1.) Parentheses '()' are used in programming to pass parameters to functions.
2.) Curly braces '{}' are used to define objects in code.
3.) Square brackets '[]' are employed for creating arrays.

Assignment
':' colon is used within objects to initialize variables, while '=' equal sign is utilized within functions.

In JavaScript, single quotes '' and double quotes "" are functionally equivalent. The backtick symbol `` offers specific features such as variable interpolation using `${variable_name}`.

Curly braces {} require a 'return' keyword when used in a function, whereas parentheses () do not.

Arrow Function "=>"

Arrow functions allow for concise code.
The left-side parentheses remove the need for 'function' and 'function_name', while the right-side parentheses handle the operation.
There's no need to explicitly write 'function' or 'function_name'.
Example: `() => ()`

Function
1.) Always use '=' for assignment.
2.) Functions without parameters are invoked using the function name.
3.) Functions with return values should be called within a 'print' section of a method with the appropriate arguments.
4.) Functions can be called using 'function_name()' or '()()', where the first pair of parentheses defines the function, and the second one is for execution.

Context
1.) Global execution context is always available and includes window methods.
2.) Function execution context pertains to the current function being executed.

Print statements are allowed within functions but not within objects.

object.function     =       variable is accessible here
object1.object2.function  =   object1 is not accessible in function =   object2 is accessible in function

Access Hierarchy
Objects can access functions.
Objects can access other objects.
Functions cannot access objects or other functions.
Checking Whether an Array is an Array or an Object

To determine whether a variable is an array or an object, you can use 'Array.isArray(array_name)'.
Access Rules

Array than Object is accessible
Maps and filters function similarly to if-else conditions, offering basic conditional logic.
