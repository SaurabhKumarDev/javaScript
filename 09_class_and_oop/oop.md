# JavaScript and Classes

Does javaScript has Classes?
Yes, JavaScript does have classes. Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES6).

Programming paradigm is a Programming style
The classes in js are primarily syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance
Means

only provided syntax, for not fell any programmers
that is done because many other programmer of another programming language are come to learn the JS
that people not feel too worst, that's why added classes in 2015

java, c++, python programmer comes here in js


## OOP

## OBjects

- toLowerCase
- trueString


## Why use OOP

- Sometime code will get mesh 

- Spaghetti code refers to a complex and tangled code structure that is difficult to read, maintain, and debug. Over time, as more developers add and modify code without optimizing the existing infrastructure, the code can become convoluted and unmanageable. Therefore, it's recommended to follow good coding practices to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
- Now we are able to use the services easily 


## parts of OOP

- Object literal
- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes 
- Instances (new, this)


## 4 pillars of OOP

Abstraction - Hide the details like fetch

Encapsulation - Wrap up the code, User can see the limited code which was want to see the user by developer

Inheritance - In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to gain the properties and methods of another class. This allows for code reuse and reduction of complexity.

Polymorphism - poly : many, morphs means forms so its means many forms.

Two type of polymorphism 
    1. Compile-time Polymorphism : achieved by function overloading and operator overloading
    2. Runtime polymorphism : achieved by method overriding
